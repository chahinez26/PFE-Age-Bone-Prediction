# Bone Age Prediction Using Deep Learning
A deep learning-based system for automated bone age assessment from hand radiographs, designed to assist pediatricians and endocrinologists in clinical practice.
## Overview
This project develops a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that automatically predicts bone age from left-hand X-ray images. The model incorporates clinical information such as patient gender to enhance prediction accuracy and has been trained on both international and local Algerian datasets.
